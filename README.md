# advent-of-code-2020

Home to my advent of code solutions for 2020. All done in clojure


## Usage


    $ java -jar advent-of-code-2019-0.1.0-standalone.jar [day] [part] [& args]
    
    or if you have lein installed
    
    $ lein run [day] [part]
    
    ie
    
    $ lein run 01 1
    
    additonal inputs vary by day but typically the first optional argument is a custom input file (it looks for files in the        resources/day-[day] folder
    
    
    Additionally running with no args will run every solved day / part combination
    
    $ lein run
